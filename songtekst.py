She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah

She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
It takes control and slowly tears you apart

Well I've been waiting, waiting here so long
But thinking nothing, nothing could go wrong, ooh now I know
She has a built in ability
To take everything she sees
And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her

Well I don't really know her, I only know her name
But she crawls under your skin
You're never quite the same, and now I know
She's got something you just can't trust
And it's something mysterious
And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her

Well she don't like losing, to her it's still a game
And though she will mess up your life
You'll want her just the same, and now I know
She has a built in ability
To take everything she sees
And now it seems I've fallen, fallen for her

She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah
She seems to have an invisible touch, oh
